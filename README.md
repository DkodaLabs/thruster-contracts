# Introduction

## What is Thruster?

We’re building a yield-first DEX on Blast for the best Blast-native teams and tokens to build on. We’re experienced DeFi builders, with backgrounds in bootstrapping and building products for large DeFi protocols. Thruster integrates the entire lifespan of a token—from zero to hero—into one protocol. For developers, Thruster supports exclusive fair launch mechanics and token management tools built by DeFi’s best; and for general users, Thruster supports advantageous yield and LP opportunities, built-in social and analytic features, and an easy trading experience. Thruster will be the home liquidity for the best tokens and DeFi/NFTFi teams building on Blast. 

We won the Big Bang hackathon/competition, and have begun to monopolize Blast mindshare amongst degens! 

## Who We Are

We’re long-time DeFi builders, with strong experience both in the space and externally via prior positions.  We would also like to acknowledge and thank the broad group of protocols and startups building alongside and on top of Thruster. We are also thankful to be directly supported by some of DeFi’s best builders and liquidity providers. These include some of Blast’s largest angel investors, liquidity providers / Blast point earners (CBB0FE, PopcornKirby, B1urr, many other top anon addresses on Blast), and some prominent DeFi founders and angels involved with large mainnet protocols. 

We spend a lot of our time working with some of the other top Blast-based DeFi, NFTFi/NFT, and SocialFi teams. We’re proud to call a majority of the Big Bang projects friends, and people that we work closely with to drive this ecosystem forward. A lot of these protocols are building on top of Thruster in some way, shape or form, whether that’s at a token level or integration level with our AMM or LP tokens.
